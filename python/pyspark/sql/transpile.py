Experimental tools for transpiling UDFS.

Transpilation is only attempted when both
``spark.sql.experimental.optimizer.transpilePyUDFs=true`` and
``spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true``. The generated Catalyst expressions
target ANSI-mode SQL semantics (overflow raises, divide-by-zero raises,
etc.); running them under non-ANSI mode would silently diverge from the
Python interpretation in ways we don't currently track. If you flip
transpilation on with ANSI off the UDF will fall back to interpreted
Python execution and a warning is logged at UDF construction time.

Python's ``+`` and ``*`` are overloaded for text (concat / repeat), so an
untyped parameter is transpiled into one option per input-type category
(numeric and string) and the JVM picks the one matching the bound column
types -- falling back to interpreted Python when none fit. Annotating the
UDF's parameters (e.g. ``def f(a: int, b: str)``) pins each category and
keeps the option matrix small; prefer doing so. To bound plan growth, a
function with more than three untyped parameters only emits one uniform
variant per category -- more than *two* when the body needs the
integral/fractional split described below, since that tries three
categories per parameter rather than two.

A lambda is lowered only when its source names it directly and alone: bind it
to a name (``f = lambda x: x + 1``, annotated if you like) and give it a line
of its own. Passed straight to ``udf(...)``, wrapped in another call, returned
by another lambda, or sharing a line with a second lambda, nothing in the
source read back says which lambda is the UDF, so it falls back to interpreted
Python rather than risk the wrong body.

Exactness and the integral/fractional split
-------------------------------------------
We only lower an operator when it matches CPython exactly, or when it raises
where CPython returns a value (the ANSI overflow case below). Anything that
would be silently wrong isn't lowered at all, so the UDF falls back.

Some operators can't meet that bar until we know the *kind* of number, since
``numeric`` covers both integers and doubles: ``**`` lowers to repeated
multiplication (exact on ints, rounds per step on doubles, where CPython
calls libm ``pow``), ``//`` needs ``div``, which rejects fractional input,
and the bitwise operators and shifts are int-only in Python. ``/`` is the
mirror image: it needs a fractional operand, or two int32 ones. Bodies using
any of those emit one option per kind, tagged ``"integral"`` or
``"fractional"``; everything else keeps the single ``"numeric"`` option it
always had. Annotating ``int`` / ``float`` pins the kind to one option.

A word on "float", which is unavoidably overloaded here: Python's ``float``
*is* an IEEE binary64, so it corresponds to Spark's ``DoubleType``, and this
docstring says "double" for that throughout. Spark's ``FloatType`` is
single-precision and has no Python counterpart at all -- see the last
fall-back below.

No exact lowering exists for these, so they fall back:

* ``a / b`` on two bigints. Python divides the exact integers and rounds
  once, Spark casts each to double first, so past 2^53 they differ by an
  ULP. int32 columns are exact (both operands are representable, so the
  double division is correctly rounded), and so is any ``/`` with a double
  operand.
* ``round()`` on a double. ``bround`` rounds the shortest decimal repr, so
  ``bround(2.675, 2)`` is 2.68 where Python's ``round(2.675, 2)`` is 2.67.
* ``//``, ``**``, ``min()`` and ``max()`` on doubles -- the last two because
  Python's NaN comparisons are all False, so ``min`` / ``max`` return their
  first argument, while ``least`` / ``greatest`` order NaN highest either way.
* Anything on a ``FloatType`` column. Python has no single-precision float:
  the value arrives widened to a Python float (a double) and every step runs
  in double, while an expression that stays in ``FloatType`` rounds to 24 bits
  per step. Under ANSI coercion a literal promotes the expression to double
  (``x + 4`` and ``x * 3.0`` are double, and so is ``x / y``), but two float
  operands keep it there -- ``x + y``, ``x * y`` and ``x % y`` all diverge, on
  398 of 398 sampled random pairs for ``(x + y) * y``. Nor is it only trailing
  digits: float32 overflows to infinity where Python has room to spare
  (``-9.726323523430302e29 * -260872823898112.0`` is ``inf`` in FloatType and
  ``2.5373334837038975e44`` in double). A FloatType *return* type would mask
  the rounding for one operation but not for a chain, and not the overflow at
  all. ``ResolveTranspiledPythonUDFOptions`` therefore excludes ``FloatType``
  from every numeric category, next to ``DecimalType``.

  That exclusion is deliberately coarser than exactness alone requires:
  comparisons, ``abs`` and unary minus *are* exact on a float column (ANSI
  coercion sends a float-vs-integral comparison to double, and comparing two
  floats gives the same answer at either width). Refusing them too costs those
  bodies a lowering, which is throughput rather than correctness, and buys a
  boundary drawn per column type instead of per operator -- the same trade
  ``DecimalType`` already takes. Making it per-operator is a reasonable
  follow-up, not a prerequisite.

Three tiers of divergence
-------------------------
Not every difference between the lowered expression and CPython is a defect.
They sort into three tiers. Most rows below are pinned by a test in
``test_udf_transpile_hypothesis.py`` (see its "Bounds 4" section for the
tier-2 pins) or ``test_udf_transpile_unit.py``; the "evaluation count" row is
a plan-shape property with no result to assert, so it is documentation only.

**1. Semantically equal.** The two sides are indistinguishable to any
consumer of the UDF's declared return type, so these are documented rather
than guarded:

* *Which exception object.* Where both sides raise, the type and message
  differ -- Python's ``ZeroDivisionError`` against ANSI's ``DIVIDE_BY_ZERO``,
  ``ValueError`` on a negative shift count against our ``raise_error``. The
  UDF contract is "this input raises", and both honour it.
* *The sign of a zero.* ``_python_mod`` follows the dividend for a zero
  result where Python follows the divisor, so ``4.0 % -2.0`` is ``0.0`` here
  and ``-0.0`` in Python. They compare equal, hash equal, and print
  differently only through ``math.copysign`` / ``repr``.
* *Intermediate width.* ``**`` and the shifts cast their operand to
  ``LongType`` before operating, so a tinyint input runs its arithmetic wider
  than the column type. Python has no width at all, so widening moves the
  lowering *towards* Python; the declared return type is what either side
  finally produces. Visible in ``explain()``, not in results.
* *Evaluation count.* ``//``, ``<<`` and ``min``/``max`` reference an operand
  more than once (a floor correction, an overflow round-trip, a NULL guard)
  where Python evaluates it once. Operands here are pure column reads, so
  this costs plan size and nothing else.

**2. Value-visible, and deliberately kept.** These need runtime values rather
than types to detect, so no static check can route around them. They are
accepted, documented, and pinned:

* *A result too wide for the declared return type.* Python has no width at all,
  so it just answers; a UDF declared ``-> LongType`` cannot return
  13835058055282163709 however wide we compute, and raises CAST_OVERFLOW on the
  final cast. Interpreted Python does not raise here -- ``makeFromJava`` accepts
  only Byte/Short/Int/Long for LongType, so a wider Python int matches no case
  and the row becomes NULL. We deliberately don't copy that: raising tells the
  caller their return type is too narrow, where a NULL silently loses the row.
  For a *narrower* declared type the interpreted path is worse still -- it
  applies ``.toByte`` / ``.toShort`` / ``.toInt``, so a UDF declared
  ``-> ByteType`` turns 500 into -12 without a word. Raising beats reproducing
  that.

  This used to be a much blunter edge, and ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``**`` and
  ``abs()`` no longer reach it merely by overflowing an *intermediate*. Operand
  promotion (see ``_promoting`` and ``PythonNumericPromotion``) widens the
  arithmetic to a type the input widths prove cannot overflow, so ``x + 4`` on
  an int column at Integer.MaxValue and ``abs(x)`` on a smallint holding -32768
  both compute now instead of raising. ``<<`` and a negative ``round()`` scale
  are the two that still overflow on their own terms.
* *NULL against TypeError.* Numeric arithmetic is not NULL-guarded: ``x + 1``
  on NULL is NULL, where Python raises ``TypeError``. The comparison,
  ``min``/``max`` and string-concat lowerings *do* guard, because there Spark
  would otherwise return a plausible wrong answer (or a wrong string) rather
  than a NULL. Guarding every arithmetic operand too would cost a branch per
  operand on the hottest path for a divergence that at least never produces a
  wrong *number*.

NaN used to sit in this tier. It no longer does: Spark treats ``NaN = NaN`` as
true and orders NaN above every value where Python makes every NaN comparison
False, but NaN-ness is a runtime test rather than a static one, so
``_nan_guard`` reproduces Python exactly. It is emitted only where NaN can
actually occur -- both operands numeric, and not both provably integral -- and
never for strings, where ANSI ``isnan`` would raise CAST_INVALID_INPUT.

**3. Refused.** Everything else -- the fall-backs listed above. Where a
Python error has no Catalyst equivalent we raise rather than return a
different value: both shifts on a negative count, and ``min()`` / ``max()``
on NULL, which ``least`` / ``greatest`` would silently skip.

    * ``f = lambda x: x + 1`` -- lambda bound to a name, annotated or not
    * ``lambda x: x + 1`` -- bare expression (getsource on a raw lambda)
    * ``def f(x): ... return x + 1``
    * a class with a ``__call__`` method

    its parameter names are what tell a located lambda apart from a rival.

    Returns the node and an empty reason, or ``None`` and why -- paired so no refusal
