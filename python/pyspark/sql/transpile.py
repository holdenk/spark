Experimental tools for transpiling UDFS.

Transpilation is only attempted when both
``spark.sql.experimental.optimizer.transpilePyUDFs=true`` and
``spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true``. The generated Catalyst expressions
target ANSI-mode SQL semantics (overflow raises, divide-by-zero raises,
etc.); running them under non-ANSI mode would silently diverge from the
Python interpretation in ways we don't currently track. If you flip
transpilation on with ANSI off the UDF will fall back to interpreted
Python execution and a warning is logged at UDF construction time.

Python's ``+`` and ``*`` are overloaded for text (concat / repeat), so an
untyped parameter is transpiled into one option per input-type category
(numeric and string) and the JVM picks the one matching the bound column
types -- falling back to interpreted Python when none fit. Annotating the
UDF's parameters (e.g. ``def f(a: int, b: str)``) pins each category and
keeps the option matrix small; prefer doing so. To bound plan growth,
functions with more than three untyped parameters only emit the
all-numeric and all-string variants.

Scalar pandas UDFs
------------------
A scalar pandas UDF receives one ``pandas.Series`` per argument and must return a
Series, so most of the lowerings above -- which were written against Python
scalars -- do NOT carry over. Only the subset whose Python-scalar meaning
coincides with pandas' element-wise meaning is reused, selected by the strict
allowlist in :func:`_check_series_semantics`: parameter references, ``int`` /
``float`` / ``str`` constants, ``+`` ``-`` ``*`` ``%``, unary ``+`` / ``-``, and
``<param>.isnull()`` (with the ``.isna()`` / ``.notnull()`` / ``.notna()``
aliases). Everything else falls back to interpreted Python. The exclusions are
not conservatism for its own sake -- each one is a construct whose scalar
lowering would be actively wrong on a Series:

* ``if x:``, ``x and y``, ``not x`` -- pandas raises
  ``ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous``. Lowering them to
  ``CASE WHEN`` / ``AND`` / ``NOT`` would turn a UDF that raises today into one
  that returns values.
* ``x is None`` -- always ``False``, because the *Series object* is not None.
  ``isnull(a)`` would answer a different question; ``x.isnull()`` is the
  construct that means what ``x is None`` means for a scalar.
* ``x < y`` and friends -- a missing value compares ``False`` under numpy
  (never ``NULL``, and never a ``TypeError``, so the ``raise_error`` guard the
  scalar lowering emits is wrong), and NaN compares ``False`` where Spark orders
  it above every value.
* a body that never references a parameter (``return 1``) -- the result is a
  scalar, which the interpreted path rejects with ``UDF_RETURN_TYPE``.

Two pandas-specific value rules are then reproduced explicitly:

* NaN in the result is serialized as NULL -- but only in the default dtype regime,
  where the result Series is numpy-backed and the return path masks it with
  ``series.isnull()``. A pandas masked extension array (which is what
  ``spark.sql.execution.pythonUDF.pandas.preferIntExtensionDtype=true`` produces,
  including for any float arithmetic promoted off an ``Int64`` column) is handed
  to Arrow with ``mask=None`` instead, and its ``isnull()`` is False for NaN in
  any case, so there the same NaN arrives as NaN. Catalyst keeps NaN, so a numeric
  body is wrapped in an ``isnan -> NULL`` normalization that reproduces the
  default regime -- and transpilation is refused outright when that conf is on,
  since no single expression covers both.
* ``Series.isnull()`` is True for NaN on a numpy-backed Series -- by the time the
  UDF runs, the Arrow-to-pandas conversion has already collapsed a NULL in a
  fractional column into NaN and pandas cannot tell them apart -- so it lowers to
  ``isnull(a) OR isnan(a)`` rather than to ``isnull(a)`` alone. (On a masked
  extension array ``isnull()`` is the mask alone, but that regime is refused per
  the previous point.)

What remains divergent is numpy's fixed-width arithmetic, and it is documented
rather than guarded because it cannot be detected without the runtime values.
Every case is one where the transpiled expression raises or is exact and the
interpreted one is lossy, silent, or inconsistent:

* integer overflow wraps under numpy where ANSI raises ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW. This
  also covers the ``%`` boundaries the ``Mod`` lowering notes below
  (``Long.MinValue % -1``), and a literal too wide for the column's dtype, where
  numpy raises ``OverflowError`` and Catalyst widens exactly.
* ``a % 0`` has no single interpreted answer to reproduce: pandas promotes to
  ``float64`` and yields NaN (so, NULL), unless
  ``spark.sql.execution.pythonUDF.pandas.preferIntExtensionDtype`` is on, in which
  case it yields ``0``. ANSI raises REMAINDER_BY_ZERO, and that is what the
  transpiled expression does.
* a ``float32`` column keeps ``float32`` through a ``float`` literal (NEP 50)
  where Catalyst promotes to double.
* an integral column is converted to ``float64`` as soon as the batch contains a
  NULL, losing precision above 2**53 -- which makes the interpreted answer depend
  on how rows happen to be batched, and is avoided by
  ``preferIntExtensionDtype=true``.

        the UDF as ``None`` rather than the bool Python would have
        produced. Hand-roll the four cases via ``when`` branches.

        When the two operands resolve to concrete but DIFFERENT categories
