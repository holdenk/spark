/**
 * Prunes the per-input-type options carried by a [[TranspiledPythonUDF]] down to those whose
 * declared categories match the resolved argument types and whose expressions themselves resolve.
 *
 * A Python operator such as `a + b` is overloaded for text, so the transpiler emits one option
 * per input-type variant -- a numeric `Add` and a string `concat`, say -- each tagged with the
 * input-type categories it expects. Those options are children of the node, so leaving a
 * type-incompatible or unresolved one in place (a numeric `Add` over string columns, or a Cast
 * that never resolves) would make `CheckAnalysis` raise INTERNAL_ERROR on the whole plan. We can
 * only choose once the argument types are known, which is after reference resolution -- hence a
 * rule here rather than in the builder, which runs at call-construction time before the columns
 * are bound -- and we must run before `CheckAnalysis`.
 *
 * Matching is strict by category (a numeric option only for numeric columns, a string option only
 * for string columns). We deliberately do not lean on implicit type coercion, which would, e.g.,
 * make a numeric `Add` "valid" over a string column and silently diverge from Python's
 * `TypeError`. An option that matches by category but fails to resolve is dropped the same way.
 * When none survive, the list is emptied and `ConvertToCatalyst` falls back to the original
 * Python UDF.
 *
 * "integral", "integral32" and "fractional" narrow "numeric" rather than sitting beside it, and
 * that overlap is deliberate. Some Python operators only have an exact lowering once the operand's
 * *kind* of number is known -- `x ** 3` as `x*x*x` is exact on a bigint but rounds twice on a
 * double, and `a // b` needs `div`, which rejects fractional input -- so the transpiler tags those
 * options with the narrower category and leaves everything else on plain "numeric". A body using
 * no such operator produces the same options, and the same plan size, as before they existed.

  // True when each declared category matches the corresponding argument type:
  // "numeric" -> Byte/Short/Integer/Long/DoubleType, "string" -> StringType,
  // "bool" -> BooleanType, "binary" -> BinaryType. "string" matches only StringType
  // (not BinaryType): a
  // bytes/BinaryType column is tagged "binary" instead, so the string lowerings
  // (e.g. `repeat`) never see it. Empty categories means "no restriction", so the
  // option is kept.
  //
  // The narrow numeric categories (see the class doc):
  // - "integral" -> Byte/Short/Integer/LongType, for `//`, the bitwise operators, the
  //   shifts, `**`, `round` and `min`/`max`, none of which have an exact double lowering.
  // - "integral32" -> Byte/Short/IntegerType, for true division: int32 values are all
  //   exactly representable as doubles, so the double division is correctly rounded and
  //   matches Python's int/int division. LongType doesn't (past 2^53 the cast to double
  //   rounds first), so bigint columns get no option and fall back.
  // - "fractional" -> DoubleType, which lets `a / b` lower for a double operand
  //   since Python also converts to double before dividing. Python's `float` is an
  //   IEEE binary64, so DoubleType is its counterpart; FloatType has none, which is
  //   the third exclusion below.
  //
  // Three deliberate exclusions keep the transpiled semantics faithful to Python:
  // - DecimalType is NOT "numeric" (nor "fractional", which it extends): Python
  //   receives decimal.Decimal objects, which raise TypeError when mixed with float
  //   literals and carry different precision semantics than Spark's decimal
  //   arithmetic, so decimal columns fall back to interpreted Python.
  // - FloatType is NOT "numeric" (nor "fractional"): Python has no single-precision
  //   float, so a FloatType value arrives in the UDF widened to a Python float (a
  //   double) and every operation on it is evaluated in double precision. Where an
  //   expression stays in FloatType -- which under ANSI coercion means both operands
  //   are floats, since an int or double literal promotes the whole expression to
  //   DoubleType -- Spark rounds to 24 bits per step where Python rounds to 53. So
  //   `x + y`, `x * y` and `x % y` on two float columns diverge; sampling random
  //   float pairs, `(x + y) * y` disagreed on 398 of 398 rows. It is not only a
  //   trailing-digit difference: float32 overflows to Infinity for operands Python
  //   handles comfortably (-9.726323523430302E29 * -260872823898112.0 is Infinity in
  //   FloatType and 2.5373334837038975E44 in double). Declaring a FloatType return
  //   type would hide the rounding for a single operation but not for a chain of
  //   them, and not the overflow at all -- and the return type isn't visible from
  //   here anyway. Float columns therefore fall back to interpreted Python.
  // - "string" requires the default UTF8_BINARY collation: under a non-binary
  //   collation (e.g. UTF8_LCASE) Spark's `=`/`<`/`concat` follow collation
  //   rules while Python compares codepoints, so `'abc' == 'ABC'` would return
  //   true where Python returns False.
